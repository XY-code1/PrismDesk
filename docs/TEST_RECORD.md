# Test record — Windows 11 — 2026-09-25

## Automated

Commands:

```text
npm run check  -> PASS
npm test       -> PASS (7/7)
npm run build  -> PASS
```

Covered: strict theme validation (unknown script field and ranges rejected), closed/invalid CDP ports, declarative injection generation, scoped cleanup, and settings reload from a new Store instance.

## WorkBuddy 5.5.3.0 — real client

Executable detected at the standard per-user install location. It was not running, so PrismDesk launched it with `--remote-debugging-address=127.0.0.1 --remote-debugging-port=9223`. The discovered target was a WorkBuddy `renderer/index.html` page on the loopback WebSocket endpoint.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Aurora apply | PASS — one renderer acknowledged `prismdesk-background` |
| Re-apply | PASS — exactly 1 background, 1 style, 1 canvas |
| Image apply | PASS — one managed `data:image/png;base64` image node |
| Motion off | PASS — static frame retained; no repeating RAF is started by payload branch |
| Restore | PASS — renderer reported restored; follow-up status was connected/not applied |
| Visual readability | PASS — privacy-safe screenshot below |
| Input, copy, scroll, modal | NOT YET MANUALLY EXECUTED; no claim of verification |

The screenshot masks the entire sidebar before capture and contains no chat list, account identifier, credential, or user background. The temporary mask was removed before restoration.

## Codex 26.917.9434.0

Installation and running process were detected. Codex was already hosting the task used to build PrismDesk, so it was not restarted. Live injection, screenshot, interaction tests and restoration remain pending rather than being reported as supported.

## Packaging

Renderer/main bundles were produced locally in `dist/`. Windows installer generation is pending: Electron's binary download was reset/timed out in this environment, so no installer path is claimed. The checked-in `electron-builder` configuration produces NSIS and portable artifacts under `release/` once dependencies can be downloaded.
